Thank you for participating in our study! Your task is to determine whether AI answered correctly or incorrectly to a question.
It consists of two parts:
<ol>
    <li>Task training: the right answer will be shown after each of your decision.</li>
    <li>Task evaluation: the right answer will not be shown.</li>
</ol>
Each question and AI answer have some set of properties which might influence its correctness.
The question and answer itself is blurred so you can focus solely on these properties.

<!-- Bonus will be paid out based on your total score. -->
Too low a score in the evaluation phase will lead to a rejection.
Think about your decision for at least a few seconds.
<!-- <br><br>
Please do not consult any external sources.
This will be monitored and might lead to disqualification. -->
If you already participated in a study similar to this one, you will be disqualified.
