Thank you for participating in our study! Your task is to determine whether AI answered correctly or incorrectly to a question.
Each question and AI answer have some set of properties which influence its correctness.
The question and answer itself is blurred so you can focus solely on these properties.

<!-- Bonus will be paid out based on your total score. -->
In addition to your base pay, you get +3p bonus when you answer correctly and lose -3p from your bonus when you answer incorrectly.
Too low a score in the evaluation phase (close to 50% - chance) will lead to <em>overall</em> rejection of your submission.
Please think about your decision for at least a few seconds.
